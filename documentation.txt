Here’s a step-by-step implementation guide and README for your AI Chatbot MVP, tailored for a product photography tool with dynamic model selection and prompt-driven image generation.

AI Chatbot MVP: Product Photography Tool
1. Project Overview
Purpose: Enhance product photography by letting users upload images, remove backgrounds, and generate creative variations (backdrops, AI humans, templates) using open-source AI models.
Features: Dynamic model selection, prompt-driven generation, thumbnail preview, interactive canvas, and iterative prompting.
2. Core Workflow
a. User Uploads Product Image
Sidebar: Upload high-resolution product image.
Background removal: Process image client-side or via API.
b. AI Chatbot Prompts
Display starter prompts:
“Perfume backdrop”
“Add AI human”
“Select from template”
Allow custom user prompts.
c. Model Selection
Let user choose from available open-source models (e.g., Stable Diffusion, ControlNet, etc.).
Store model list in config or fetch from API.
d. Image Generation
Send uploaded image + prompt to selected model API.
Generate 4 thumbnail variations.
Show thumbnails in chatbot UI.
e. Thumbnail Selection
User selects a thumbnail.
Preview selected image in canvas (drag/resize/delete).
f. Iterative Prompting
User can send new prompts for further variations.
Chatbot sends current image and context to model API for updates.
3. Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
Step 1: UI Setup
Sidebar: Upload, background removal, parameter controls.
Chatbot: Starter prompts, prompt input, model selector, thumbnail grid.
Canvas: Preview, drag/resize/delete.
Step 2: Model API Integration
Define API endpoints for each model (REST or WebSocket).
Support dynamic model selection (dropdown or buttons).
Send image + prompt to API, receive generated images.
Step 3: Chatbot Logic
Display starter prompts as clickable buttons.
Allow custom prompt input.
On prompt/model selection, call API and show loading spinner.
Display 4 thumbnails as selectable images.
Step 4: Canvas Integration
On thumbnail selection, update canvas with new image.
Allow further editing (drag/resize/delete).
Step 5: Iterative Generation
Store current image/context.
On new prompt, send current image and context to API for new variations.
Step 6: Documentation & README
